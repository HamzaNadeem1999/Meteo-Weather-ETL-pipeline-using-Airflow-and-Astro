# Astronomer Project

Welcome to my Astronomer project! This was set up with `astro dev init` using the Astronomer CLI. Here’s a quick guide to the project structure and instructions for running Apache Airflow locally.

## Project Structure

- **dags**: Contains Python files for Airflow DAGs, including an example DAG that queries the Open Notify API to list astronauts currently in space.
- **Dockerfile**: Uses an Astro Runtime Docker image for running Airflow. Add any runtime overrides here.
- **include**: Holds additional files you might want in the project.
- **packages.txt**: List OS packages for installation here.
- **requirements.txt**: Specify Python packages here.
- **plugins**: Add custom Airflow plugins here.
- **airflow_settings.yaml**: Define Airflow connections, variables, and pools locally.

## Running Airflow Locally

1. Start Airflow by running:
   ```bash
   astro dev start
